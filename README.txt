This is a (barebones) map viewer for Kirby: Triple Deluxe. Build using Qt 5.

You need a decrypted RomFS dump in order to do anything with this. Don't ask me where to get one.

Objects and items are currently displayed (by name, not graphically); enemies arent. Collision, visual layers, and breakable blocks can be toggled on/off.

Info about enemy types/states, objects, and other items is displayed in a tool window. Double click a state/object/item for some (minimal) information about it.
