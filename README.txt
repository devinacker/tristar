This is a (barebones) map viewer for Kirby: Triple Deluxe. Build using Qt 5.

You need a decrypted RomFS dump in order to do anything with this. Don't ask me where to get one.

Collision, visual layers, and breakable blocks are currently displayed using their ID as a color. Enemies, objects and items are currently displayed by name. All of these can be toggled on/off.

Info about enemies/enemy types, objects, and other items is displayed in a tool window. Double click an enemy/object/item for some (minimal) information about it.
