This is a (barebones) map viewer for Kirby: Triple Deluxe and Return to Dream Land. Build using Qt 5.

You need either a Wii disc image or a decrypted RomFS dump in order to do anything with this. Don't ask me where to get one.

For Triple Deluxe:

Collision, visual layers, and breakable blocks are currently displayed using their ID as a color. Enemies, objects and items are currently displayed by name. All of these can be toggled on/off.

Info about enemies/enemy types, objects, and other items is displayed in a tool window. Double click an enemy/object/item for some (minimal) information about it.

For Return to Dream Land:

Collision and visual layers are displayed seemingly correctly (for the most part) in the same manner as above. Enemies, objects, and items aren't displayed at all yet.
